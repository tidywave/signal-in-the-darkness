## Faith is Good

There is satisfaction and clarity in faith. Faith completes one's worldview. Think of empirical knowledge as the tip of an iceberg. This is everything that everyone can agree with. If that is the limit to one's worldview, one cannot develop a more complete understanding of everything that's beneath the water.

## Faith and Science

The compatibility between faith and science is as follows:

We can model one's worldview as a series of up and down arrows based on statements one deems true (`^`) or false (`v`):

```text
^^vv^
```

From a Bayesian perspective, this is what is called a "prior" set of assumptions. They are either proven by empiricism or by one's faith. Credence should be given to empiricism, but there is plenty of room beneath the surface for faith to influence one's worldview.

If new evidence comes in to challenge one's faith, that evidence should be scrutinized, but it should also not be ignored.

It is also worth noting that if a single point of this worldview is incorrect, that has no bearing on the other prior assumptions, assuming they were independently formed.

For example, if the first leaning in my worldview was that dogs are evil, I might read some studies or acquire some positive life experience with dogs to reshape that worldview like so:

```text
v^vv^
```

This has no bearing on my second leaning that dogs wag their tails when they're near me. That still holds true despite me having seen the world from an upside-down perspective on my previous point.

## Trust is Faith in Humanity

Faith is separate from knowledge in that it is a choice to believe in something without definitive evidence.

Trust is faith in one's fellow human. We need trust in order to do business with one another, and in order to build a broader society.

Applying the Bayesian model of trusting one's fellow human leads one to the motto "trust, but verify."

A little bit of trust is necessary before truly know one another. Without initial trust, we would never form meaningful connections with one another.
