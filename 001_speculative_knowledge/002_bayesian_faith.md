## Faith fills in the gaps

An iceberg can represent the distinction between empirical knowledge and reality itself. Empirical knowledge from science represents the tip of the iceberg. Every other unknown resides beneath the surface of the water, inaccessible to us. If that is the limit to one's worldview, one cannot develop a more complete picture of the iceberg. However, with limited empirical knowledge, the picture of the iceberg may be incorrect.

There is satisfaction and clarity in faith. Faith completes one's worldview.

Uncertainty remains the most honest approach to the unknown. Many consistent theories have yet to be proven.

## Keeping faith honest

We can model one's worldview as a series of up and down arrows based on statements one deems true (`^`) or false (`v`):

```text
^^vv^
```

From a Bayesian perspective, this is what is called a "prior" -- a set of truth statements to propositions either proven by empiricism or prior assumption. New empirical data should suggest corrections to the prior.

It is also worth noting that if a single point of this worldview is incorrect, it has no bearing on the other independently formed prior assumptions.

For example, if the first leaning in my worldview was that dogs don't like people, I might read some studies or acquire some positive life experience with dogs to reshape that worldview like so:

```text
v^vv^
```

This has no bearing on my second leaning that dogs wag their tails when they're near me. That still holds true despite me having seen the world from an incorrect perspective on my previous point.

## Trust can be a form of faith

Faith is separate from knowledge in that it is a choice to believe in something without definitive evidence.

Trust can be a form of faith. Trust can be built and destroyed, through former experience with individuals, groups, businesses, devices, and really anyone or anything we interact with.

A little bit of trust is necessary before we truly know one another. Without initial trust, we would never form meaningful connections.
