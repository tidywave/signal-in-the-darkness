# Origin

At the beginning of the measurable universe, everything was highly ordered and tidy. This order served as a prerequisite for what scientists call the big bang, an explosive beginning of the universe as we know it. A creator or group of creators could have played a role in both setting up and facilitating such an event.

Space and time are fundamentally dependent on one another. Together, scientists call this concept spacetime. We all move through spacetime at the speed of light. If we move more quickly through space, then we move more slowly through time. At the extremes, a light particle does not experience time, while a motionless object would not move at all through space and move through time at the speed of light. Time is always ticking.

If a creator set up the big bang, that creator most likely exists separately from spacetime. There could be many possibilities for how a creator could impact events in our universe or interact with it directly. Quantum mechanics buries many mysteries worth puzzling over, and string theory is one candidate that proposes additional hidden spatial dimensions that have yet to be observed. If a creator exists, did the creator create spacetime or was spacetime an existing tool for the creator to work with?

Another question separate from universal creation is that of determinism. Is our environment set up in a way where everything was predetermined? If our course of action is similar to a ball rolling down the path of least resistance, how many of our actions are pre-determined; do we have free will to change our course?

The point of the discussion above is to get at two fundamental questions that we do not have clear answers for:

1. Is there a universal creator (God) or creators (gods)?
2. To what extent do we have free will?

Many people have different answers to the above questions. Some of this boils down to religion.

No matter your answers to the above questions, hopefully the above discussion highlights how science is compatible with most religious views. Emirical evidence is hard for us to ignore.
