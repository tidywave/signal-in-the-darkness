As children, we often learn at a young age how to play games. Games are both a tool teachers can use to teach students, and can be a tool that we leverage to teach ourselves.

Children and imaginative adults can create new games or invent new rules for existing games.

Integrity is an incredibly important value among competitive game players. Integrity helps build trust, and those players who lack integrity in a competitive game should be held accountable.

Play is a separate concept from gaming. Typically, games have a specific ruleset, however we can be playful with one another, for example, by throwing a ball back and forth.

Gaming is different from playing in that gaming is typically a goal-oriented endeavour; in most cases, the goal being winning the game.

Games typically have winners and losers. Games such as chess have one winner and one loser. However there are other games such as Jenga with one loser and no winners. These mechanics are written into the rules of each game.

Play does not require winners and losers. It is simply a state of carefree fun and learning. Play can evolve into gaming if players decide they want to dabble in a little bit of competition.
