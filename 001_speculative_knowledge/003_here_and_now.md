Faith can lead to disagreement. By definition, it formulates an opinion about something we do not know for certain.

The pessimist can look at a past assuming the worst, and predict a tragic future. The optimist can look at the same past assuming the best, and predict a thriving future. The pessimist provides us contingency plans for worst case scenarios while the optimist provides us hope. Neither agrees, but both worldviews can provide us great value.

While we can learn from the past and hope for the future, the point in time we should know the most about is the present moment. Buddhists and meditation practitioners refer to it as the here and now. The past is gone; memory is a tricky thing. The future is uncertain. What we know for certain is here and now.
