No single one of us has answers to all of our questions. A lot of what we call knowledge is speculative at best. In fact, at its most basic basic level, knowledge is an emotion that we feel when we think we are correct. It is our responsibility to discern whether or not this feeling is correct.

Humility is a powerful value; humility is the acceptance that each one of us has blind spots that others can help fill in. Humility is the acceptance that there is something bigger than ourselves. That could be the universe. That could be the earth and our communities. That could be a divine creator. Hope it's not a simulation, but if so, I'll play on.

While we can learn from the past and hope for the future, the point in time where we have the most control is the present moment. Buddhists and meditation practitioners refer to it as the here and now. This is where it is worth focusing most of our energy. Life is precious, and each moment moves past us and is gone in an instant. Focusing on the present also better enables us to reflect on the past and prepare for the future.
